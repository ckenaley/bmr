Lichanura_trivirgata,"Chappell & Ellis 1985, Andrews & Pough 1985, Ruben 1976","The Ruben paper is weird, see above. This is an interesting situation. I started re-calculating values from Chappell and Ellis, then realized that there were two entries in our database. One of the entries is the result of a name cleaning episode where I switched Ruben's values from Lichanura roseofusca to this species, as roseofusca is invalid. This is the weird point of the two in the dataset","Would suggest cutting the point that comes from Ruben 1976. Then, the correct values are just those from the original White table",NA,20,14.94307,208.5864,1.1744398309

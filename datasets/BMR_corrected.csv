Pseudoeurycea_brunnata,see notes,"White give a book. Book probably took data from an old paper. Can't get old paper, but that paper seems to have been on an agenda. Author supposedly measured this critically endangered species' BMR in Guatemala",Cut that shit,cut,,

Masticophis_flagellum,Ruben 1976,"The original paper appears to neither address shifts in metabolic rate with temperature, nor to report the mass of this species specifically. White et al. took the mass of all individuals of two different species for their table, no idea how they got the q10smr",Cut that shit,cut,,
Typhlogobius_californiensis,"They cite Bokma 2004, but he just downloaded data from www.fishbase.org","Went to fishbase. Downloaded data. Made some calculations based on the Q10 given in White. They agreed with appendix in White. Went to original paper (Congleton 1974), re-calculated values based on that. Also very low, plus he noted that this species has a much lower metabolic rate than the other two species in the study",Consider keeping,keep,,
Sebastolobus_altivelis,"They cite Bokma 2004, but he just downloaded data from www.fishbase.org",Went to fishbase and downloaded data. Re-calculated two examples. Both looked good (i.e. fit the overall fish relationship). ,Took average mass and metabolic rate of the two examples I calculated and added them here.,replace,134,14.32912
Hyla_arborea,Gatten et al. 1992,"Cannot access original data, in a book. Made some calculations based on a paper where they measured metabolic rate during calling. Unsurprisingly, those values were even higher than the values in the database. ",Cut that shit,cut,,
Lichanura_trivirgata,"Chappell & Ellis 1985, Andrews & Pough 1985, Ruben 1976","The Ruben paper is weird, see above. This is an interesting situation. I started re-calculating values from Chappell and Ellis, then realized that there were two entries in our database. One of the entries is the result of a name cleaning episode where I switched Ruben's values from Lichanura roseofusca to this species, as roseofusca is invalid. This is the weird point of the two in the dataset","Would suggest cutting the point that comes from Ruben 1976. Then, the correct values are just those from the original White table",replace,182,12.8236
Bunopus_tuberculatus,Al-Sadoon & Abdo 1989,"Went back to original data, assumed that their y-axis, which is supposedly mass-corrected metabolic rate, really is mass-corrected. Note also that White took the midpoint of their range of sizes, but they do actually give a mean size hidden in the text, which I used here","Re-calculated Q10 from extrapolations, then recalculated q10smr for 38 degrees C based on that Q10 and extrapolations. Value is more in line with predictions, though still a bit high. If they didn't really mass-correct the MR then it would be right in line",keep,2.2,2.530463
Euphlyctis_hexadactylus,Gatten et al. 1992,"Cannot access original data, in a book. These two examples are tricky. They are both Indian species, seem like a lot of work has been done on them, particularly cyanophlyctis. Used to be in Rana.","Probably just leave, but maybe cut. See cyanophlyctis",cut,,
Euphlyctis_cyanophlyctis,Gatten et al. 1992,"Cannot access original data, in a book. These two examples are tricky. They are both Indian species, seem like a lot of work has been done on them, particularly cyanophlyctis. Used to be in Rana. The datapoint in our database for this species says its mass is: 0.204323. Based on information I can find, it looks like it's mass is much closer to 31.22. But just substituting that value in makes the point stand out even more. Likely there's a problem also with the BMR being calculated based on weight. If I could see original data maybe I could fix.","Cut this species, maybe also hexadactylus",cut,,
Labeo_rohita,"They cite Bokma 2004, but he just downloaded data from www.fishbase.org",Re-calculated from fishbase data. Results similar to the White data,Not sure. Keep it I guess.,keep,,
Ambystoma_mexicanum,Gatten et al. 1992,"Cannot access original data. Tried to recalculate based on a more recent paper, but not really suited to these calculations and the new values are way off. Current values not that different than rest of Ambystoma",Not sure. Keep it I guess.,keep,,
